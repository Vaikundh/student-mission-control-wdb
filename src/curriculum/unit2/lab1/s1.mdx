# Shopping for Adirondack Chairs

**Nothing says summer like a pair of these classic outdoor lounge chairs.**

<br />

A hefty outdoor seat with a laid-back posture and wide, flat arms, the Adirondack chair has a lot to recommend it. It generally stays where you put it, resists harsh weather and has arms that double as cocktail tables. Most important, though, “it just screams summer,” said Ann Stillman O’Leary, an interior designer based in Lake Placid, N.Y., who has written books on Adirondack style. The first Adirondack chair was designed in 1903 by Thomas Lee, in Westport, N.Y., Ms. O’Leary said, to address very specific requirements: “He was looking for a chair that was comfortable, didn’t need a lot of fluffing and could hold a drink. Mr. Lee’s chair used solid slabs of wood, but countless manufacturers have since modified the design, most notably with wood slats that provide better drainage. “We now have fan-backs, shell-backs, wave-backs and round-backs,” Ms. O’Leary said. Whichever style you choose, she added, “there’s no wrong place to put an Adirondack chair.”
